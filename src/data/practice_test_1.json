      "text": "A data engineer needs to load data from an Amazon S3 bucket into Snowflake.

        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Snowpipe with SQS queue notification integration is the most appropriate solution for near-real-time data loading from S3. When new files are placed in the S3 bucket, S3 events trigger SQS notifications, which then automatically trigger Snowpipe to load the new data. This approach ensures data is loaded within minutes of arrival without manual intervention or scheduled tasks, meeting the 15-minute requirement efficiently.*"

        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The VARIANT data type in Snowflake is specifically designed to store semi-structured data like JSON, especially when the structure may vary. It allows for flexible schema handling and enables querying the JSON data using dot notation or the FLATTEN function. This approach accommodates the varying JSON structure without requiring schema conversion or normalization before loading.*"

        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Snowflake Data Sharing (Database Shares) is the most secure and efficient method for sharing data between Snowflake accounts. It allows for secure, read-only access to specific databases, schemas, or tables without copying the data. The provider maintains control over what data is shared, and the consumer can query the data directly without needing to store or manage it. This approach maintains data governance while enabling efficient collaboration.*"

        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The default behavior of the COPY command when encountering errors is ON_ERROR=ABORT_STATEMENT, which means the entire load operation will be aborted if any error is encountered. ON_ERROR=CONTINUE will skip rows with errors and continue loading, ON_ERROR=SKIP_FILE will skip the entire file if any error is found in it, and there is no ON_ERROR=SKIP_FILE_<n> option. Understanding the default behavior is crucial for designing robust data loading processes.*"

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "For near real-time data loading from an on-premises Oracle database, a change data capture (CDC) solution with Kafka as a message broker and Snowpipe for loading is the most appropriate approach. This architecture captures changes in the Oracle database as they occur, streams them through Kafka, and loads them into Snowflake using Snowpipe. This provides a scalable, reliable solution for near real-time data integration between on-premises systems and Snowflake.*"

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY is the most appropriate view to check first when troubleshooting Snowpipe issues. This view contains historical information about pipe usage, including errors and status information. It provides details about file loads, error messages, and pipe execution that can help identify why a Snowpipe has stopped loading data. The other views may provide supplementary information but are not as directly relevant to Snowpipe troubleshooting.*"

        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME option in the COPY command allows loading data from files with varying schemas by matching column names rather than positions. This option instructs Snowflake to map source columns to target columns based on names, ignoring extra columns in the source and filling missing columns with NULL values. This is ideal for handling schema variations without creating multiple staging tables or complex transformations.*"

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Using a single COPY command with a SELECT statement that includes transformations is the most efficient approach for loading and transforming data from multiple external stages. This method allows for transformations to be applied during the load process (ELT approach), reducing the need for intermediate storage and additional processing steps. The SELECT statement can include joins, filters, and other transformations to shape the data as it's being loaded.*"

      "explanation": "The FORMAT_NAME parameter in the COPY command is used to specify the file format for the data being loaded from an external stage. This parameter references a named file format object that has been created in Snowflake, which defines properties such as field delimiter, record delimiter, compression type, and other format-specific options. Using named file formats promotes reusability and consistency across data loading operations.*"

      "explanation": "Streams is the most appropriate Snowflake feature for capturing and applying incremental changes from a source table to a target table. Streams track DML changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to a table and make those changes available for processing. When combined with tasks, streams enable building efficient change data capture (CDC) pipelines that only process modified data rather than reprocessing the entire dataset. This approach minimizes processing overhead and ensures that the target table stays synchronized with the source while only processing the delta of changes, making it ideal for incremental data transformation scenarios.*"
