      "explanation": "Using Snowflake's external tables with cloud storage is the most cost-effective solution for long-term retention of rarely accessed historical data. This approach leverages cheaper cloud storage (like S3, Azure Blob, or GCS) for the actual data files while maintaining queryability through Snowflake's external tables feature. When queries are executed against external tables, Snowflake reads the data directly from cloud storage, which is significantly less expensive than Snowflake's native storage for rarely accessed data. While query performance may be somewhat reduced compared to internal tables, this aligns with the stated lower performance expectations for this historical data.*"

This enables a central team to maintain reference data in one location while securely sharing it with multiple department-specific Snowflake environments. The shared data appears as a database in the consumer account but doesn't consume additional storage, and updates to the source data are immediately visible to all consumers, ensuring consistency across departments.*"
