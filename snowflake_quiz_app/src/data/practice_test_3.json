Specifically, views like COPY_HISTORY and LOAD_HISTORY in the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE schema provide detailed information about data loading operations, including file names, row counts, error counts, and other metrics. These views maintain historical information for a longer period than the Information Schema views and provide more comprehensive details about load operations than query history alone. This makes them ideal for building load monitoring and auditing solutions.*"

Clustering ensures that recent (hot) data is co-located in the same micro-partitions, enabling efficient pruning when queries filter on recent dates. Snowflake's automatic clustering maintenance focuses on the most frequently accessed micro-partitions, naturally optimizing for hot data access patterns. Additionally, Snowflake's storage billing is based on actual compressed storage used, and clustering doesn't increase this cost, making it more cost-effective than creating duplicate structures or moving data between tables.*"

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Using a task to calculate and store aggregates in a separate table is the most effective approach for high-performance aggregations on large datasets with high cardinality group-by columns. This approach pre-computes the aggregations during a scheduled maintenance window and stores the results in a dedicated table optimized for query performance. Unlike materialized views which have certain limitations with complex aggregations, this approach provides complete control over the aggregation logic, indexing strategy, and refresh schedule. The task can be scheduled to run daily, ensuring the aggregated data is refreshed at the required frequency while minimizing the performance impact on user queries.*"
